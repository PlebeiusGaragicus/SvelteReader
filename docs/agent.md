# Important information for coding agents:

- The submodules in this repo are for reference only - our Svelte frontend/ contains our web app.  The `CypherTap` npm library is out of date, we instead use our submodule for CypherTab which includes bugfixes not included

- We always ensure to both review documentation and keep it up-to-date with code changes.  Instead of adding new files, we keep updates terse and contained in the files that reference the features.  We don't include verbose changelogs or list of refactored code elements - we simply update the existing documentation to match.
